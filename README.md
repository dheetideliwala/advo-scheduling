Devils' Advocates Scheduling

I created two versions of using tour guide data from welcome2college.com to schedule them for 100+ tours monthly. This is used in AppScripts through Google Sheets.

The first method includes TimeAvailability.js & TimeScheduling.js, where the input data is in formats of available time slots.

The second method includes ShiftScheduling.js, where input data is in formats of guide-selected shifts.
